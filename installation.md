# R and RStudio 

A quick intro, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language for data analysis, statistics and more. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is the program that interacts between you and the language R. R and RStudio are two free available software that need individual installation. R works independent from RStudio, however you can't use RStudio without R, so R comes first.
